    <p> I'm passionate about reading. Although I have several hobbies, such as watching movies and walking, reading books is what resonates well with me. There are many reasons why i love reading. The first reason is it gives me a level of fulfillment. That is, books rejuvenate me.
         After reading a book, I feel like a whole new being and my out look in life changes. The second reaseon
         is books make my mind shap and rekindle my spirit. When the outside world overwhelming for me, i just
          take a few hours of reading.

        Listening to music has always been my go to activity for all occassions. My love for music can be traced 
        back to when i was a child. There are recorded videos of me as a child becoming hyperactive when 
        when the music was played. Music is the second thing that calm me down when i worry about something.

        I always watch movie in weekend days and in summer. I love sitcom comedy, action drama, thriller 
        and animation movies. But i don't like Si-Fi and horror movies. Especially horror movies make me teriffied. 
        But overall waching movie is one of my interests.
